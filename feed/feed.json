State Identification <a class=\"c-header-anchor\" href=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/ux-of-a-disabled-button/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>The difference between a disabled button and a regular button is usually very subtle<sup>*</sup>, meaning it’s a weak indicator of state that may be missed by many of your users.</p>\n<p><i>* Designing something to look both disabled and identifiable as a button while achieving adequate contrast is tricky.</i></p>\n<h4 id=\"1-1-what-does-it-mean-to-disable-a-button-from-a-screen-readers-perspective\" tabindex=\"-1\">1.1 What does it mean to disable a button from a Screen Readers perspective? <a class=\"c-header-anchor\" href=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/ux-of-a-disabled-button/\">#</a></h4>\n<details>\n  <summary>ℹ️ What is a <i>Screen Reader</i>?</summary>\n<p>A screen reader is assistive software, primarily used by people with low or no vision. It converts the semantic elements on a web page (for example text, buttons, images and links) into audible speech or braille.</p>\n</details>\n<p>A disabled button is non-existent to a Screen Reader user, meaning they don’t even get the weak indicator afforded to fully sighted users.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/blindness-and-visual-impairment\">World Health Organization</a>, there are an estimated 285 million people in the world who suffer from some level of visual impairment (including anyone from legally blind, to those with less than 20/20 vision).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"2-unnecessary-cognitive-load\" tabindex=\"-1\">2. Unnecessary Cognitive Load <a class=\"c-header-anchor\" href=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/ux-of-a-disabled-button/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>When a disabled button is intended to act as a visual indicator that something on the page or form needs to be fixed/changed before your user can continue.\nTo those who can identify them, this usage of a disabled button simply tells them “something” is wrong and provides no more information on exactly what needs to be corrected (the user may assume that something is wrong with the application and it that needs to be reloaded).</p>\n<p>The change required to re-enable a disabled control may be appear to be a simple puzzle for your user but this is an assumption we shouldn't make for all our users.\nIntroducing this, potentially, small frustration for users with or without cognitive disabilities or even familiarity with our product is best avoided in keeping with the &quot;Don't make me think&quot; principle.</p>\n<p>Due to the contrast issues mentioned before, you can't rely on the contents of the buttons label to aid your user here as they may not be able to read it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"is-there-another-way\" tabindex=\"-1\">Is there another way? <a class=\"c-header-anchor\" href=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/ux-of-a-disabled-button/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>There are more suitable patterns and approaches available that can help us avoid using disabled buttons.\nFor example let's look at the commonly approach of using a disabled button to prevent progress on an in-complete form.</p>\n<p>❌ Don't</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Disable the submit button (hoping your user understands that you mean for them to fully complete the form before continuing)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>✅ Do</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mark all required fields (unless all fields are required or there are more optional fields than required)</li>\n<li>Let the user interact with and traverse the form, and identify the enabled submit/continue button (both by its label and location)</li>\n<li>Let them attempt to submit the form</li>\n<li>Inform the user exactly what issue is preventing them from continuing. This can be inline error message or something like the Toast alert pattern</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In other words, allow and use the users premature interaction with the control as an opportunity to inform or guide them how to continue.\nThis principle can be applied to many instances in which disabled buttons are commonly used.</p>\n<!-- ## When should a disabled button be used\n\n![animation showing an asynchronous action triggered by a button temporarily disabling a button](https://raw.github.ibm.com/DWay/not-important/master/src/images/posts/ux-disabled-buttons/disable-button-pattern.gif) -->\n",

The micro-architecture for a specific application (for example, general-purpose consumer use, enterprise-grade, scientific computing, or embedded system) and a suitable performance level.</p>\n<p>The implementation logic of the CPU is constructed by abstract specification of desired circuit behavior\nthrough the selection of appropriate components e.g. Arithmetic Logic Units (ALU), registers, and cache memory and clocks.\nThe CAD software translates these specifications into the required circuits, logic devices, and logic gates and ultimately the transistors that make them. These elements are printed, in layers, to the silicone. The design is also analyzed and simulated to assess manufacturability and design integrity.</p>\n<h3 id=\"masking-and-fabrication\" tabindex=\"-1\">Masking and Fabrication <a class=\"c-header-anchor\" href=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/how-to-trick-rocks-into-doing-math/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Manufacturing transistors, at the required scale and precision the achieve the modern CPU performance levels, is not possible with typical manufacturing processes. Even the most precise 3D printers are not suitable for the nano-metre scale of today’s chips. Photolithography is a multi-step process of using light to print or etch the design of many chips onto a thin silicon wafer.</p>\n<p>The printing process begins in a sterile environment by applying hydrogen peroxide to a substrate to remove any contaminants. A thin layer of silicon is deposited on the substrate and spun to uniformly cover it in another layer of photo-resistant chemical which is then baked into place. This layer is less than 2 micro-metres thick. A photo mask of the chip design is placed above the wafer and an extreme intensity UV light source is focused through it. This projects an image of the design that exposes and chemically alters the photoresist where the light reaches it. The photoresist is then treated to develop the exposed regions, preventing further light-induced alteration, and washed away from the unexposed regions. A chemical is used to remove the uppermost layer of the substrate not covered by the photoresist mask, etching the design into the wafer. The photoresist is removed, the surface is polished, and the process is repeated in as many layers as needed to complete the chip design.</p>\n<h2 id=\"packaging\" tabindex=\"-1\">Packaging <a class=\"c-header-anchor\" href=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/how-to-trick-rocks-into-doing-math/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The delicate silicone die added to a carrier is attached to the printed circuit board (PCB) allowing it to connect, via a pin and socket, to the rest of the computer system. A heat-spreading component is mounted on top to transfer heat away from the circuits.</p>\n<h2 id=\"testing-and-binning\" tabindex=\"-1\">Testing and Binning <a class=\"c-header-anchor\" href=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/how-to-trick-rocks-into-doing-math/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>CPUs are very complex and rely on an incredible level of precision on a microscopic scale. A lot of effort is put into avoiding defects but when they do occur, binning is used to mitigate waste. If the defect occurs in a redundant or non-essential component of the CPU like a core, that component is disabled and the CPU is sold as a lower-end part.</p>\n<p>The CPUs are then packaged for retail to customers or sold to OEMs for inclusion in their products.</p>\n",
