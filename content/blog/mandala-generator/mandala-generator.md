{% blockquote "What Is a Mandala?", "https://artincontext.org/what-is-a-mandala/" %}
A mandala can be described as a circle or geometric design that is controlled or enclosed within a square and arranged in sections that are structured around one central point. <br/>
In Buddhist and Hindu cultures, a mandala embraces a lot of symbolism and represents various aspects of Buddhist teachings. It is also an instrument used for prayer, mostly in Japan, Tibet, and China.

This simple project was an evening experiment with the browser [Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API).

Inspired by the brilliantly designed puzzle game [Monument Valley](https://www.monumentvalleygame.com/mvpc), where at the end of each level, in a brief moment of artistic expression, you generate a glyph or mandala-like design by dragging your finger clumsily across the screen.

This afterthought of a design element provides a surprisingly calming, gratifying and tactile experience as you can see your intricate creation taking shape in real-time.

The interaction and output capture the concept of "simple to use, challenging to master" and reminded me of the rhythmic motion and almost meditative experience of turning the wheels of an Etch-a-sketch toy.

I wanted to understand, reverse-engineer and try to emulate a similar effect of how effortless input gestures can be translated into precise, intricate and detailed patterns.

The results were not as polished or captivating as an actual mandala or the Monument Valley version, but it's still worth trying.
