Getting started with a screen reader has never been more straightforward and accessible. If you're reading this on an Apple device, you already have a screen reader installed and may have even turned it on by accident.

Unsure what a screen reader is or want to learn more about the benefits of familiarizing yourself with a screen reader. In that case, I've also written about [why designers should learn to use VoiceOver](../why-designers-should-learn-voice-over).

## How to use a screen reader

These are the controls required to use VoiceOver to a basic level.

VoiceOver has its built in tutorial and is worth the ~20 minutes it takes to complete. You can find it by opening `System Settings` > `Accessibility` > `VoiceOver` > `VoiceOver training`.

To stay familiar with the basics of VoiceOver, I find it helpful to attempt to complete a task with it once a week, for example, sending an email or reading a news article.

To test yourself, try lowering your screen brightness to it's lowest setting and attempt to use [wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) to find out how many people were on the Titanic.
