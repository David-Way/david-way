Building a product and watching other people use and get value from it is a very rewarding feeling and something I appreciate deeply about my job.
Building tools for others to create with has somehow felt less rewarding to me. One step too far removed from the act of the craft maybe. Who wants to be the coach when you can be the player?

However, I recently built a tool, a [stone aged warp weighted loom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warp-weighted_loom), for a local weaving expert and I've found the feeling of creative reward really changes when you're supporting a star player like Marja, the Michael Jordan of weaving let's call her.

## The Weaver

For the last 40 years Marja has been a Weaving/textile history and heritage enthusiasts, and for 6 years a weaving instructor in the [Liberties Weavers project](https://www.thelibertiesweavers.ie/about).

## Design

The research needed to design a tool for a technical skill, and rich domain knowledge can take as long or longer than building the tool itself. While I'm still unable to weave myself (did you know Leo Fender, founder of Fender Musical Instruments, couldn't play a note on the guitar), my partner has been learning and practicing weaving for almost two years and so was an accommodating Subject Matter Expert to user test with.

Some features and functions of the finished loom include:

- Rotating cloth beam and sliding latch for weaving materials longer than the length of the loom.
- Knock-down joinery to allow the loom to be disassembled when not in use or for transport.
- Compact lean-to design allows the loom to be used in a confined space.
- adjustable fork arms to allow you to stand, sit in a chair, or on the floor when weaving.
- Natural beeswax finish to avoid tarnishing the weaving yarn.
