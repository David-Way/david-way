Project Title(1 Line) & Subtitle (1-2 Lines)

<details>
<summary>A headline and subtitle that indicates the name and goal of the project</summary>
A short concise headline that couples the name of the brand/application/client and goal of the project. A lot of designers tend to rush the naming of their project but it is crucial in capturing the attention of its reader. It is the first thing a recruiter is going to read to decide whether or not to carry on reading your UX case study.

Make sure it is clear, understandable, and does not use technical jargon. The subtitle is optional but a great way to build more context around the Project title.

</details>

### Client/Company/Project type(1 Line)

<details>
<summary>Give background</summary>
**Client/Project:** Unless stated in the title, this helps build more background to who the project was for. If the project was not a commercial project for a client or brand, this is where you can state that it was a conceptual project, a design challenge, or a practice project.
</details>

### Project date(1 Line)

<details>
<summary>Time or duration</summary>
**Duration:** When or how long the project was helping the recruiter establish whether this is your most recent work and most importantly, to gauge where your skill level is. Always try to put up work that is recent because it’s an accurate reflection of your skills.
</details>

### Your role (1 - 2 lines)

<details>
<summary>What you actually did on the project</summary>
This is a section to state everything you did and were responsible for. Recruiters are looking to accurately assess your skills in the context of the entire project’s execution. Did you work with a team, did you work unsupervised to create the project deliverables. Recruiters can make an informed decision about whether you will need help on the job or hit the ground running.
</details>

### Project Summary/About this Project (1-2 Paragraphs)

<details>
<summary>An overview that summarises the project, goal, and results</summary>
This is a critical section for any reader who does not have a lot of time to read through the entire case study but wants a brief summary of the project, goals, and results. They may be going through a stack of applications and only have a few minutes to scan over one or two projects in your portfolio. Usually the first two. If nothing stands out or if the work is unclear then they will quickly move on.
</details>

### The challenge (2 - 3 paragraphs)

<details>
<summary>What specific problem, user needs, business requirements, and/or pain points that the project solves. Were there any technical constraints or business KPIs you had to keep in mind? Who are your users and what are their specific needs</summary>
This section specifically looks at the problems the project is trying to address. What are the business requirements, user needs, pain points that the project solves? Who are the end-users and core target market? What platforms was the project for and were there any technical constraints or business KPIs you had to keep in mind
</details>

### Solution (As long as needed)

<details>
<summary>What method/process was used to solve the problems? How features addressed the objectives?</summary>
This section is going to be the longest as it showcases how the project goals were achieved. Firstly, outline the design process steps and methods followed during the project outlines the layout of this section. Show your overall project steps, why you chose the methods you used, Recruiters want to see all the relevant design artifacts that you produced from sketches to visual mockups to prototypes.

Other deliverables that you can show:

- Personas
- Sketches
- Interview notes
- Usability tests results
- Whiteboards
- Wireframes
- UI designs
- Prototypes
</details>

### Results (1 paragraph)

<details>
<summary>Project success metrics, awards, reflections, project next steps, and/or lessons learned.</summary>
The critical last section concludes the case study by outlining any project success metrics that were achieved, awards that were won. In the case of a project that is not live, reflections and the project’s next steps are sufficient to round up the case study. Try to share any lessons that you learned to demonstrate you are invested in both the project’s life cycle and your career development.
